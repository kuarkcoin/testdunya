    "text": "<p><strong>The Global Pollinator Crisis</strong><br/><br/>In recent years, the populations of pollinators, particularly honeybees, have been declining at an alarming rate worldwide. This phenomenon, known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), was first identified in 2006 when beekeepers in the United States began reporting that 30-90% of their hives were dying during the winter. Since then, similar patterns have been observed in Europe and parts of Asia.</p><br/><p>Scientists have identified several potential causes for this decline. The primary suspect is the widespread use of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides used to coat seeds. When plants grow, the chemical permeates the pollen and nectar, which bees then consume. Research indicates that these chemicals damage the bee's central nervous system, affecting their ability to navigate and return to the hive.</p><br/><p>Another significant factor is habitat loss. As urban areas expand and monoculture farming dominates the landscape, the diverse wildflowers that bees rely on for nutrition are disappearing. Without a varied diet, bees' immune systems weaken, making them more susceptible to parasites like the Varroa mite.</p><br/><p>The economic implications are staggering. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 71 of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of the world's food are pollinated by bees. Without them, the production of apples, almonds, coffee, and even cotton would plummet, leading to global food insecurity.</p>",

    "title": "Passage 2: The History of Glass",
    "text": "<p><strong>Origins of a Transparent Material</strong><br/><br/>Glass is one of the most versatile materials in human history, yet its origins remain somewhat shrouded in mystery. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder attributed the discovery of glass to Phoenician sailors. According to his account, the sailors set up a camp on a beach and used blocks of natron (a natural soda) to support their cooking pots. When the heat of the fire melted the natron and mixed it with the beach sand, a transparent liquid stream was formed—glass.</p><br/><p>While this story is charming, archaeological evidence suggests that true glass was likely first made in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) or Egypt around 3500 BC. Initially, it was a luxury item used for beads and small vessels, accessible only to the wealthy elite. It wasn't until the invention of the blowpipe by Syrian craftsmen in the 1st century BC that glass production became faster and cheaper, allowing it to become a common household material.</p><br/><p>In modern times, glass has evolved significantly. We now have tempered glass for safety, fiber optic glass for internet cables, and even 'smart glass' that can change its opacity with electricity. Despite these advancements, the core ingredients—silica sand, soda ash, and limestone—remain remarkably similar to those used thousands of years ago.</p>",
