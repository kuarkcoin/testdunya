    "sample_answer": "The bar chart illustrates the gender distribution of students enrolled in engineering courses at Australian universities over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2010.\n\nOverall, it is evident that the number of male students significantly outnumbered female students throughout the entire period. However, while the number of men remained relatively stable, there was a noticeable upward trend in the number of women choosing to study engineering.\n\nIn 2000, the disparity was most pronounced, with approximately 14,000 male students compared to only 2,000 female students. Over the next five years, the figure for men fluctuated slightly but remained around the 14,000 mark. In contrast, the number of female students grew steadily, reaching 4,000 by 2005.\n\nBy 2010, the number of male students had peaked at just under 16,000. Meanwhile, the female intake continued to rise, ending the period at 6,000. Although women still represented a minority in the engineering faculty, their numbers had tripled over the decade, indicating a gradual shift towards gender balance in this field."

    "question": "Some people believe that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "min_words": 250,
    "time": 40,
    "sample_answer": "In the digital age, the role of traditional schooling is often questioned, with some arguing that the internet and computers are now more vital for a child's education. While technology provides access to limitless information, I strongly disagree that it can replace the comprehensive educational and social benefits provided by schools.\n\nProponents of digital learning argue that the internet allows for personalized, self-paced learning. A child can access tutorials on complex scientific theories or learn a new language through an app, often more engagingly than a textbook. For example, platforms like Khan Academy offer resources that some rural schools might lack. Therefore, as a source of raw information, the internet is indeed superior.\n\nHowever, education is not merely about acquiring facts; it is about social development and discipline. Schools provide a structured environment where children learn to interact with peers, resolve conflicts, and work in teams. These soft skills are crucial for future employment and cannot be learned from a screen. Furthermore, teachers play a mentorship role, guiding students not just academically but morally, helping them distinguish between credible sources and misinformation online.\n\nIn conclusion, while computers and the internet are powerful tools that enhance learning, they cannot replace the holistic development offered by schools. A balanced approach, where technology supports the school curriculum, is the most effective method for educating the next generation."
